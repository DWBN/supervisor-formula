Some things that I'd like to change in the near future

- [ ] allow customization inside scripts (service name, config file)
- [ ] somehow ensure that pip is available
- [ ] add a system group and directory permissions
- [ ] allow programs, and groups generation inside ``include_confdir``
      (i.e. pillar -> supervisor.lookup.include_confdir)
- [ ] document installation, usage and pillar configuration
